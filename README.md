Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Implementation in Python

This repository contains an implementation of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) representation of the input space. This implementation is particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.
Features

    Initialization modes: Diagonal, One Point, Random
    Adjustable learning rate, neighborhood influence, and number of neurons
    Dynamic neighborhood updating and k-closest neighbors calculation
    Visualization support for the training process
    Mapping of data points to neurons for cluster identification

Dependencies

    numpy
    matplotlib
    sklearn (for example data generation)

Installation

No specific installation steps are required apart from ensuring the required dependencies are installed. You can install the dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage
Step 1: Import the SOM class and auxiliary functions

Import the SOM class and the necessary functions from the provided script.

python

from som_module import SOM, analyze_array

Step 2: Prepare Your Data

Prepare your dataset. You can use any numerical dataset. For demonstration purposes, we use a dataset generated by sklearn.datasets.make_blobs.

python

from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
data, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=50, n_features=7, random_state=42)

Step 3: Initialize the SOM

Create an instance of the SOM class. Specify parameters like the number of neurons, epochs, learning rate, influence, neighbor update frequency, and initialization mode.

python

num_neurons = int(np.ceil(np.sqrt(data.shape[0])))
epochs = 100
learning_rate = 0.3
update_neighbors_epoch = 5
influence = 0.1
calculate_k_epoch = 2
k_neighbors = 5

som = SOM(data, num_neurons, epochs, learning_rate, influence, update_neighbors_epoch, calculate_k_epoch, k_neighbors, randomize_data=False, init_mode='diagonal')

Step 4: Train the SOM

Train the SOM with your dataset. You can view the training process in real-time by setting step_by_step=True.

python

mapped_data = som.train(step_by_step=True)

Step 5: Analyze the Results

After training, you can analyze the mapped data to understand how the data points have been clustered.

python

print(analyze_array(mapped_data))

Step 6: Visualizing the SOM (Optional)

The implementation supports visualization during training. Ensure step_by_step is set to True to enable this feature.
